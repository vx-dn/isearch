# üßπ AWS Infrastructure Cleanup Guide

## Quick Cleanup (Recommended)

To stop all services and delete all AWS resources:

```bash
cd /home/dev/psearch/receipt-search-app/backend/deploy
./cleanup.sh
```

This script will:
1. ‚úÖ Delete all Lambda functions
2. ‚úÖ Empty and delete S3 buckets  
3. ‚úÖ Delete DynamoDB tables
4. ‚úÖ Terminate EC2 instances (Meilisearch)
5. ‚úÖ Remove VPC and networking
6. ‚úÖ Delete Cognito user pools
7. ‚úÖ Remove API Gateway
8. ‚úÖ Delete SQS queues
9. ‚úÖ Clean up local files

**Cost Impact**: All AWS charges will stop immediately.

## Verification

After cleanup, verify everything is deleted:

```bash
./verify_cleanup.sh
```

## Manual Cleanup Options

### Option 1: Terraform Destroy Only
If you just want to use Terraform to destroy infrastructure:

```bash
cd ../../infrastructure/terraform
terraform destroy -auto-approve
```

### Option 2: Selective Cleanup
If you want to keep some resources, you can manually delete:

#### Delete Lambda Functions
```bash
aws lambda delete-function --function-name receipt-search-dev-api --region ap-southeast-1
aws lambda delete-function --function-name receipt-search-dev-image-processor --region ap-southeast-1
aws lambda delete-function --function-name receipt-search-dev-text-extractor --region ap-southeast-1
aws lambda delete-function --function-name receipt-search-dev-cleanup-worker --region ap-southeast-1
```

#### Empty S3 Buckets
```bash
# Get bucket name
BUCKET_NAME=$(cd ../../infrastructure/terraform && terraform output -raw receipts_bucket_name)

# Empty bucket
aws s3 rm "s3://$BUCKET_NAME" --recursive --region ap-southeast-1
```

#### Stop EC2 Instance (Meilisearch)
```bash
# Get instance ID
INSTANCE_ID=$(cd ../../infrastructure/terraform && terraform output -raw meilisearch_instance_id)

# Stop instance
aws ec2 stop-instances --instance-ids "$INSTANCE_ID" --region ap-southeast-1

# Or terminate completely
aws ec2 terminate-instances --instance-ids "$INSTANCE_ID" --region ap-southeast-1
```

## Immediate Cost Stoppers

If you need to stop costs immediately but plan to resume later:

### 1. Stop EC2 Instance (Biggest cost)
```bash
cd ../../infrastructure/terraform
INSTANCE_ID=$(terraform output -raw meilisearch_instance_id)
aws ec2 stop-instances --instance-ids "$INSTANCE_ID" --region ap-southeast-1
```

### 2. Delete Lambda Functions (No ongoing cost, but stops usage)
```bash
./cleanup.sh  # Answer 'no' when it asks to empty S3 buckets
```

## Recovery

If you need to redeploy later:

```bash
# Redeploy infrastructure
cd ../../infrastructure/terraform
terraform apply -auto-approve

# Redeploy Lambda functions  
cd ../../backend/deploy
./deploy_lambda.sh --all
```

## Cost Breakdown

When everything is deleted, you'll save:

| Service | Monthly Cost | Status After Cleanup |
|---------|-------------|---------------------|
| EC2 (t3.small) | ~$15-20 | ‚úÖ Terminated |
| NAT Gateway | ~$32 | ‚úÖ Deleted |
| S3 Storage | ~$1-5 | ‚úÖ Deleted |
| DynamoDB | ~$0-5 | ‚úÖ Deleted |
| Lambda | ~$0-1 | ‚úÖ Deleted |
| API Gateway | ~$0-1 | ‚úÖ Deleted |
| **Total Savings** | **~$50-65/month** | **‚úÖ All costs stopped** |

## Troubleshooting

### If cleanup.sh fails:
1. Check AWS credentials: `aws sts get-caller-identity`
2. Manually empty S3 buckets first
3. Run terraform destroy manually
4. Check for remaining resources with `./verify_cleanup.sh`

### If resources remain:
- Some resources may have delete protection
- Check AWS Console for any remaining resources
- CloudWatch logs may take time to expire naturally

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- **Backup Data**: Make sure you have backups of any important data
- **Terraform State**: The cleanup script preserves terraform.tfstate for potential recovery
- **Immediate Effect**: Most resources are deleted immediately
- **Billing**: It may take up to 24 hours for all charges to stop appearing in AWS billing
